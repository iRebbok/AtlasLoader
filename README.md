# AtlasLoader
- Port from [Atlas](https://gitlab.com/AsheHat/atlas) old version of Patcher & Mod Loader for SCP: SL.

## Credits

### Atlas
- A .NET compile-time and run-time modification framework.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/AsheHat/Atlas)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/AsheHat/atlas) - the repository moved to github

### AssemblyPublicizer (Took an idea for CLI)
- A tool to create a copy of an assembly in which all members are public (types, methods, fields, getters and setters of properties).
- [GitHub](https://github.com/CabbageCrow/AssemblyPublicizer)

**CoreRT doesn't support the dynamic library loading API, so a fully native patch will not work.**

### What is it for?
**To load mods into SCP: SL, but mainly for [SMBootstrapper](https://github.com/iRebbok/SMBootstrapper).**

### Support/docs?
**No.**
